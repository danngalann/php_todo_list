# php_todo_list
A simple web app I made for learning purposes. It's made following a tutorial series by [Codecourse](https://codecourse.com) (tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfdtiltiRHWEWpkWMls6o0QOVoweLevR-)), with a few improvements including:

* Added "delete" and "undo" options for every item in the list.
* Prevented XSS while displaying user input.
* Deleted the "add" button; the items are inserted by pressing ENTER.

## Want to try it?
In order to display the list, you'll need a web server with MySQL and PHP7. I used [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).

Import the [SQL FILE](php_todo_list.sql) into MySQL and open [index.php](index.php).
